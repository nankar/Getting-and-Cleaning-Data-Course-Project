# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project:

Getting and Cleaning data course project works on data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

Contents:

CodeBook.md - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.
run_analysis.R - R script to download source data, merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
tidy_dataset.txt - Output file generated by the run_analysis.R script.
README.md - This file.


Getting started:

Read the CodeBook and the run_analysis.R script to get a general understanding of this project, analysis done to clean data, and required output file.
Run the run_analysis.R script.

run_analysis.R reads in the processed experiment data and performs a number of steps to get it into summary form.

Scripts downloads the file from source link
test and train datasets are read in and merged into one data frame.
The data columns and activity labels are then given names based on the features.txt and activity_labels.txt
using grepl mean or standard deviation measurements are selected from the given dataset and other columns are excluded from the rest of the analysis.
The activity identifiers are replaced with the activity labels based on the activity_labels.txt file.
The data is then grouped by subject and activity, and the mean is calculated for every measurement column.
resultant summary dataset is written to a file, tidy_dataset.txt.
